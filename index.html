        Project Break The Cycle works closely with the Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare to impact local youth.
        HTSW is composed of an orphanage that houses 44 children year-round.
        Providing more than just shelter, the Home supports youth by providing them with access to private education, new clothing, clean and nutritious diets, as well as a safe space for maturation.
        The Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare grants these children opportunities at obtaining proper private educations for future success.

        The Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare was founded in 1975, drawing its name from its location in the second largest city in Lebanon. A group of concerned locals, led by Mr. Mostafa Ziadeh and Ms. Suha Ziadeh, worked to establish the organization in its early years. After Mr. Mostafa Ziadeh passed away in 1991, Ms. Suha Ziadeh, his wife, took on his responsibilities at the orphanage. While growing up, Ms. Ziadeh observed what her local orphanage was doing to its children and thought about what could be changed to create a more positive environment. She recalled that the center looked like a prison: children were constantly trying to makes holes in the walls to escape because of the orphanage’s policy for keeping all the doors locked. Ms. Z concluded that nobody was raising and educating the children correctly. In adulthood, she realized that she needed to act upon her childhood instincts and help work to fix the situation. The War of Lebanon was a particularly powerful motivator. This civil war accounted for an increase in fatherless children, poverty, and rates of illiteracy among women. In addition, this war decreased the amount of resources available for people to use inside the country. There were fewer jobs, and the youth had much less infrastructure than their parents’ generation.

        <div class="div3text">In 1975, the Lebanese government donated less than $1/day per child to cover their expenses. Today, the government donates approximately $4/day per child to cover expenses. This is obviously not enough to cover basic costs, including electricity, water, food, etc. Although electricity may seem to be cheap in the USA, Lebanon does not have electric power 24/7. When there is no power throughout the city, the center must use its own diesel-powered generator to produce electricity. Alongside other factors, this increases daily costs drastically. Over the course of the center’s existence, Ms. Ziadeh has taken in both orphans and needy children off of the streets and into a safe and loving environment. Unfortunately, the center is an all-boy orphanage because she does not have the resources to support both boys and girls. However, in the future, she hopes that she will open another center that provides the same opportunities and resources for girls.

        <div class="div3text">HTSW is committed to changing children’s lives. Its goal is to make sure that children can apply what they have learned to their daily lives. This includes academic knowledge, as well as etiquette. At the Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare, workers and volunteers treat each child like their own, providing them with a source of love and comfort. As opposed to their lives before joining the organization, each child gets served three fresh meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. To establish etiquette, all of the children eat with each other at the same time. This equates to a sense of family and unity, which, unfortunately, is lacking within their communities. Organization is a key pillar of HTSW. For example, each child has his own medical file that is kept private and neat. Checkups and doctor visits are routinely scheduled. However, all of these intensive services require monetary support beyond what the government of Lebanon provides.
